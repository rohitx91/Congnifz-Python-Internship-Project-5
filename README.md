# Congnifz-Python-Internship-Project-5
 Level 1 Task 5: Palindrome_checker for Cognifyz Python Internship.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Cognifyz Technologies Python Internship (Level 1 – Task 5).  
The goal of this task is to create a Python program that checks whether a given word or number is a palindrome.

A palindrome is something that reads the same forward and backward.  
Examples: *madam*, *121*, *racecar*.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Accept text or numbers from the user  
- Remove spaces and convert input to lowercase  
- Reverse the text using Python slicing  
- Compare original vs reversed text  
- Display whether it is a palindrome or not  

## 🧠 Features
- Works for both numbers and words  
- Removes spaces before checking  
- Case-insensitive validation  
- Clean and simple Python logic
   
📍Example Output
Enter a word or number: madam
'madam' is a palindrome!
